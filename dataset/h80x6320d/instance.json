  "abstract_problem": "A drought-stricken region is constructing water supply pipelines to transport water from a water source to various villages. There are a total of {num_nodes} water transport nodes, with IDs from 1 to {num_nodes}. Only the node with ID {source_node} is the water source, with a total supply of {total_supply}, while other nodes are demand points. The supply or demand quantities are specified in `nodes`, where positive values indicate supply, negative values indicate demand, and 0 indicates that the node itself does not require water supply but can serve as a transit point as needed. Each pipeline has a fixed construction cost and a variable cost per unit of flow, see `edges`. The network must form a tree structure (each node has at most one incoming edge). The objective is to minimize the total cost (construction cost + flow cost).",
