  "abstract_problem": "We have I processing orders and N CNC machine tools, and each order must be assigned to a specific machine tool for production. Each order generates a specific amount of waste heat during processing, and the heat generation value of each order is stored in the table weight.csv. The assignment is subject to process precision constraints, which are stored in the table B1. More crucially, the workshop is connected to a complex heat dissipation pipeline system: a specific 'order-machine tool' assignment will discharge waste heat into a shared specific exhaust main. Each exhaust main can operate for a maximum of T days within a year. In the table B2, each row represents a specific exhaust main, with a total of M mains, followed by the 'order-machine tool' assignments that discharge waste heat into the main, denoted by (i j) (where i stands for the order and j stands for the machine tool). If a certain 'order-machine tool' assignment is implemented, the heat generated by the corresponding order will be input into the relevant exhaust main. Our optimization objective is to find a production scheduling scheme that, on the premise of satisfying the process requirements, minimizes the heat load of the exhaust main with the highest temperature in the entire factory, preventing pipeline burst or equipment shutdown due to overheating.",
