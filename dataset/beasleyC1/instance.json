  "abstract_problem": "A logistics operator is redesigning a regional backbone to move a standardized commodity between sites. The backbone contains {num_nodes} sites and {num_arcs} candidate directed links. Activating a link requires a fixed operating fee, and only activated links can carry shipments.\n\nDemand pressure is summarized as a net surplus or shortage at each site. The plan must route shipments across the activated links so that every site is balanced according to these net requirements. Each activated link can carry at most {capacity_per_arc} units of shipment. The goal is to choose which links to activate (and how to route the shipments) to satisfy all site requirements while keeping the total fixed operating cost as low as possible.",
