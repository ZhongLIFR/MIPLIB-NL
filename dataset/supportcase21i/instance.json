  "abstract_problem": "An enterprise IT solutions provider is optimizing its service delivery portfolio to better align with the evolving needs of its diverse client base. The central task is to curate a strategic selection of technical support modules,standardized problem-solving protocols,that can be deployed across the organization's service infrastructure. Management aims to construct a robust support framework that guarantees every unique client requirement is met with sufficient expertise, all while keeping the overhead of maintaining these active support modules within a tight budget.\n\nThe operational dynamics are complex: each support module comes with a specific deployment cost but offers varying degrees of effectiveness in addressing different client needs. Furthermore, client requirements are not binary; they have specific thresholds of satisfaction that must be cumulatively met by the combined capabilities of the deployed modules. Therefore, the decision-making process must navigate a multidimensional landscape to identify the most cost-efficient combination of modules. The goal is to ensure that the aggregate problem-solving power of the selected portfolio meets or exceeds the minimum service levels demanded by every client requirement, thereby delivering a comprehensive support solution without unnecessary expenditure.",
