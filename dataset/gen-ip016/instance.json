  "abstract_problem": "The Strategic Computation Reserve is currently finalizing the hardware acquisition strategy for its Phase IV infrastructure expansion involving {n} distinct classes of processing nodes. The specific theoretical processing yield per unit for each node class is documented in the `items` registry. The primary objective is to determine the optimal integer procurement quantity for each node class to maximize the facility's total theoretical processing yield. Operational integrity is strictly governed by {m} distinct environmental and logistical load vectors, covering metrics such as thermal dissipation, power draw density, and rack footprint. The `constraints` dataset establishes the absolute upper tolerance limit for each of these vectors. The specific load contribution generated by a single unit of each node class against these vectors is detailed in the `coefficients` matrix. Nodes possessing an identification index corresponding to a prime number undergo a specialized legacy compatibility verification sequence during the initial boot phase. The annualized hardware depreciation is calculated using a standard 15 percent straight-line amortization schedule. The aggregate load on any given vector is the summation of contributions from all procured units and must not breach the established tolerance limits. Calculate the maximum attainable total theoretical processing yield.",
