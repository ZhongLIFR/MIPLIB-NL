  "abstract_problem": "We are modeling the steady-state behavior of a neuromorphic chip architecture composed of {n} processing neurons. The neurons are sequentially indexed from 1 to {n}. In this architecture, neurons with indices divisible by 3 are designated as Clock Synchronization Nodes, which regulate the timing stability of the circuit, while the remaining neurons function as Arithmetic Logic Units. Regardless of their designation, every neuron `i` receives signal inputs from three specific upstream neurons `j`, `k`, and `l`. The state of any neuron is binary: Active (1) or Idle (0). The activation logic for the subsequent clock cycle is governed by a specific lookup table (LUT) characteristic to each neuron. The file `network_rules` specifies the circuit topology and the 8-bit response vector (columns b0 through b7) for each neuron `i`. These columns correspond to the output state of neuron `i` given the binary input combination of `j`, `k`, and `l` (mapped from 000 for b0 to 111 for b7). During the chip's testing phase, we observe a static leakage current of 12nA for every Active node, and the total thermal design power is estimated by multiplying the total active count by a voltage coefficient of 1.2V. The goal is to identify a Homeostatic Equilibrium state for the chip. A Homeostatic Equilibrium is defined as a system state where the activation pattern of all neurons remains unchanged between consecutive clock cycles. To establish a baseline for the solver, we seek a valid equilibrium configuration that minimizes the activation state of the first neuron (x1).",

      "description": "A table of size n*12, defining the update rules for the Boolean network. Each row corresponds to one node. The columns are: `i` (the node's index, 1 to n), `j`, `k`, `l` (indices of the three input nodes), and eight 0/1 columns `b0` through `b7`. These eight columns represent the truth table for the node's update function. `b0` corresponds to the input state (xj, xk, xl) = (0, 0, 0); `b1` to (0, 0, 1); `b2` to (0, 1, 0); and so on, up to `b7` for (1, 1, 1). If a column `b_m` is 1, it means the corresponding input combination activates the node `i` (i.e., makes its next state 1). The node `i`'s next state is 1 if at least one of its activating input combinations is present; otherwise, its next state is 0.\nData format:\n| i | j | k | l | b0 | b1 | b2 | b3 | b4 | b5 | b6 | b7 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 130 | 251 | 329 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 2 | 217 | 279 | 319 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |"
