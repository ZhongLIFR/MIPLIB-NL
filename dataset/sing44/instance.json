  "abstract_problem": "A service operator must meet an exact coverage requirement across {T} indexed time slots. In each slot, the operator can assemble coverage from three sources.\n\nFirst, there are pre-qualified adjustable segments. Each segment is associated with exactly one slot. If a segment is activated, it must deliver a coverage amount within a specified lower and upper threshold for that segment; if it is not activated, it delivers nothing. Delivered coverage from adjustable segments is charged per unit.\n\nSecond, there are discrete actions. Triggering an action incurs a fixed charge and produces predetermined coverage contributions in one or more slots according to a predefined contribution pattern.\n\nThird, there are emergency fallback options. Each fallback option is tied to one slot. Purchasing an amount from an option increases coverage in that slot by the same amount and is charged at that option's unit price. A slot may have multiple fallback options with different unit prices.\n\nIn addition to the coverage requirement, the operator must comply with a large set of internal policy rules. These rules are expressed as signed balance identities over a collection of binary decision nodes (some nodes correspond to activating a segment, some correspond to triggering an action, and others are internal auxiliary states). Only selections that satisfy all such identities are allowed.\n\nThe goal is to minimize total cost while exactly matching every slot's coverage requirement and satisfying all policy rules.",
