  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are the scheduling manager of a facility with N1 employees and N2 distinct shift patterns. Each employee must be assigned to exactly one shift pattern, and each shift pattern must be covered by at least one employee. There are two operational constraints for each shift: a total workload limit and a total labor cost limit. The workload contribution and labor cost of each employee vary depending on the shift they are assigned to, as shown in Table C1 and Table C2, respectively. The maximum allowed workload and labor cost for each shift are provided in Table C3. While covering all shifts is mandatory, strictly adhering to the limits is flexible but incurs penalties. Your goal is to assign employees to shifts in a way that minimizes the total violation (the sum of excess workload and excess cost) above the specified limits.",
