  "abstract_problem": "The University Resource Allocation Committee (URAC) requires a compliant optimization of the Semester Course Schedule. The scheduling horizon is defined as a standard academic week of {D} operational days, each subdivided into {P} instructional periods (so {T} time slots in total). The objective is to allocate temporal resources to a portfolio of {C} academic courses while strictly adhering to physical and policy constraints.\n\n**Resource Constraints:**\n1. **Physical Infrastructure**: The campus classroom inventory is provided in the associated data files. Capacity compliance is mandatory. Classroom capacity is managed through capacity thresholds (defined by the distinct capacities present in the inventory and penalty data). For each threshold, there is a limit on how many classes can use rooms that can accommodate at least that many seats. If a scheduled meeting cannot be accommodated at a given threshold and must rely on smaller rooms, it may still proceed but generates a 'Capacity Shortfall' penalty. The weight of this penalty depends on the course and the threshold (weights range from {penalty_min} to {penalty_max}). A missing (course, threshold) weight implies zero penalty; however, every scheduled meeting still consumes classroom resources and must respect the cumulative limits implied by the inventory. Note: The campus has a global safety limit of {max_rooms_per_slot} simultaneous classes per period. Time slots are labeled using the scheme 'D<day>P<period>' (e.g., 'D0P0' for the first period of the first day).\n2. **Temporal Availability**: Certain courses have restricted availability. These are documented as 'Blackout Periods' in the associated data files. Any slot not explicitly blackouted is considered viable.\n\n**Curricular Constraints:**\n1. **Conflict Avoidance**: To ensure degree progression, {CP} pairs of courses sharing student cohorts must not be scheduled concurrently. These mutual exclusions are pre-computed in the associated data files.\n2. **Distribution Requirements**: Each course requires a fixed number of weekly meetings and should be spread across at least a minimum number of distinct days. If it is taught on fewer days than desired, a per-missing-day penalty with weight {w_days_below} is incurred.\n3. **Cohort Continuity**: {Q} Academic programs (Curricula) should avoid 'fragmented schedules'. An additional penalty with weight {w_isolated} is incurred when a curriculum has an isolated occurrence within a day: the curriculum has teaching in a period but has no teaching in the adjacent period(s) of the same day. Isolation is evaluated for every period of a day; boundary periods (first and last) consider the single adjacent period.\n\n**Objective:** Minimize the weighted sum of all penalty points (Capacity Shortfalls + Distribution Failures + Schedule Fragmentation).",
