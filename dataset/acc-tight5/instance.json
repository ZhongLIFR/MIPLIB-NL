  "abstract_problem": "A media operator must build a highly constrained operational plan by selecting discrete options across a collection of decision slots.\n\nEach slot requires choosing exactly one option from its allowed menu. Options are interconnected: selecting one option can force other options to be selected, and additional global rules restrict how many options may be chosen from certain collections.\n\nAll decisions are binary and all rules are linear. The objective is to avoid selecting one particular undesirable option unless it is unavoidable, while still satisfying all slot-level choices and all inter-option rules.\n\nThe instance data provides: (1) the option list and objective penalties, (2) the slot menus (exact-one choice groups), (3) implication links between options, and (4) capped groups with upper/lower/equality bounds.",
