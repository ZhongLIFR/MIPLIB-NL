  "abstract_problem": "An automotive manufacturer is designing its next-generation flagship electric vehicle platform. The vehicle consists of M core subsystems (e.g., battery pack, electric motor, electronic control system, body material, suspension system, intelligent driving chip, thermal management system). The R&D team has provided several different alternative options (suppliers or technical routes) for each subsystem, and exactly one option must be selected from the several options of each subsystem (mutual exclusion constraint). Engineers must choose precisely one option from each subsystem to form a complete prototype vehicle. Meanwhile, the marketing and regulatory departments have listed N key performance indicators (KPIs), and these N constraints represent the physical formulas for N performance tests. The result of each test depends on the linear combination of the selected alternative options for the subsystems. If the combined performance value meets a specific threshold, the test is deemed 'compliant'; if not, it is deemed 'non-compliant'. Our goal is to maximize the number of compliant tests.",
