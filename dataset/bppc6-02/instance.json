  "abstract_problem": "Now there are I flights and N aprons, and we must assign a specific apron to each arriving flight. Each flight carries a specific number of passengers, and the passenger capacity of each flight is stored in the table weight.csv. The assignment is subject to aircraft type restrictions, which are stored in the table B1. More crucially, there is a complex passage network inside the terminal building: a specific \"flight-apron\" assignment will direct passenger flow to specific areas (such as specific customs channels or baggage halls). In table B2, each row represents a specific area (there are M areas in total), followed by the \"flight-apron\" assignments that direct flow to that area, denoted as (i j) (where i represents the flight and j represents the apron). If a specific \"flight-apron\" assignment is fulfilled, it will direct the passenger count of the corresponding flight to that area. Our optimization objective is to find an apron assignment plan that, on the premise of satisfying aircraft type matching, minimizes the passenger flow in the bottleneck area with the maximum passenger flow in the entire airport, preventing stampedes or excessive congestion.",
