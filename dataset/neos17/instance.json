  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are the Credit Risk Director of a bank. You have historical data for N1 customers, and you want to build a linear credit scoring model based on N2 financial features (such as income, debt ratio, etc.). The model calculates a weighted score for each customer using these N2 features. If the score minus a specific threshold (intercept) is greater than a small margin, the customer is classified as 'Good'; if it is less than a negative small margin, they are classified as 'Bad'. Since linear separation is rarely perfect, the model allows for classification errors, but each error incurs a specific penalty cost (based on the customer's importance or loan amount). Your goal is to determine the optimal weight for each feature and the optimal threshold to minimize the total misclassification cost, subject to a normalization constraint where the sum of all weights and the threshold equals 1.",
