  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are the logistics director of a polar expedition. You need to transport N different types of modular equipment to a remote base. Each equipment type has a specific 'Scientific Value' (or Cost), as shown in Table C1. The transportation mission is subject to M1 types of resource constraints (such as weight, volume, etc.) and must meet M2 types of performance requirements (such as power generation, thermal protection, etc.). \n\nThe resource consumption of each equipment type is listed in Table C2, and the maximum limit for each resource is listed in Table C3. The performance contribution of each equipment type to the required metrics is listed in Table C4, and the minimum required standard for each performance metric is listed in Table C5.\n\nPlease output the quantity of each equipment type to be transported to minimize the total cost (or maximize value) while satisfying all resource limits and meeting all performance standards.",
