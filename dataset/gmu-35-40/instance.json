  "abstract_problem": "We need to develop an optimal harvest schedule for a large-scale forestry region. The region is divided into M distinct timber stands (harvest units), and the planning horizon spans T operational periods (batches indexed 0 to T−1). Our primary objective is to maximize total revenue by making decisions based on the estimated timber value of each stand in each period (data provided in R.csv).\n\nIn this plan, the status of each stand in each period is binary: either \"harvest\" or \"reserve.\" To ensure operational sustainability and regulatory compliance, the following three business rules must be strictly observed:\n\n1. Operational Conflict Rules (Mutually Exclusive Activities) Due to constraints such as geographical proximity, road usage, or equipment scheduling, conflicts exist between certain harvest plans. Table C1.csv lists several groups of \"mutually exclusive activity lists\" (one group per row). For the \"Stand-Period\" combinations listed in each group, at most one may be approved for execution to avoid operational conflicts.\n\n2. Supply Chain Stability (Harvest Volume Smoothing) To ensure a stable supply of raw materials for downstream processing plants, we cannot harvest excessively in one year and have no supply the next. Therefore, the total harvest volume in each period must transition smoothly relative to the previous period. Specifically, for batches 2 through (T−1), the total harvest volume of each batch must be no less than N1 times that of the preceding batch and no greater than N2 times that of the preceding batch. C2.csv provides the estimated yield for each stand in different periods.\n\n3. Ecological Red Line Mechanism (Environmental Loss-Gain Balance) We must balance economic interests with ecological protection. Certain harvesting activities cause environmental damage (negative values indicate loss), while other specific operations (such as thinning or clearing diseased trees) may bring ecological improvements (positive values indicate gain). Table C3.csv defines multiple ecological assessment metrics. For each metric, the positive ecological gains generated by our selected plan must be sufficient to offset the negative environmental losses (i.e., the net impact value must be non-negative), thereby ensuring the balance of the ecosystem.",
