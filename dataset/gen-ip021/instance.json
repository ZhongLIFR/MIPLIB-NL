  "abstract_problem": "The Strategic Orbital Defense Initiative 'Aegis' is finalizing the procurement blueprint for its primary hull shielding construction. We have access to a supply chain of {n} composite laminate materials, listed with their base unit acquisition cost in table `materials`. The operational environment presents {m} distinct cosmic radiation hazard vectors, with minimum required cumulative suppression values listed in table `radiations`. The physical efficacy of a single layer of each material against each hazard vector is mapped in table `interactions`. Operational protocols dictate that materials with IDs divisible by 5 are sourced from deep-space miners and are subject to a mandatory 3-week quarantine delay upon arrival at the shipyard to prevent contamination, which impacts the project Gantt chart. Furthermore, to support the station's projected 20-year lifecycle, a fiscal sinking fund is established where an amount equal to 5% of the total acquisition cost is deposited annually to cover future micrometeoroid impact repairs. The engineering team requires a configuration specifying the integer quantity of layers for each material type. The optimization objective is to minimize the immediate base acquisition cost to secure the initial Phase 1 contract. The design must ensure the sum of attenuation factors for each radiation type is no less than the specified safety limits derived from the `radiations` table.",
