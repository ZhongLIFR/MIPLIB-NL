The salary of each employee is provided in Table C1; some of these employees are interns who are willing to pay for the internship opportunity, hence their salaries are negative values.The contribution of each employee to each task is detailed in Table C2; some employees may have a negative impact on certain tasks, resulting in negative contribution values. Each task has a predefined completion threshold listed in Table C3. We need to help the company identify an optimal employee hiring plan that minimizes the total cost while ensuring all tasks meet their respective completion thresholds.Output the minimum cost.",
