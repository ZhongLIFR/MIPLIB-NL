  "abstract_problem": "A transportation provider plans a set of profitable operations by selecting a consistent set of discrete choices. Each choice represents committing to an option, a linkage, or an activity segment, and every choice has a net cost that can be positive (expense) or negative (profit credit).\n\nA central feature of this instance is consistency across multiple representations of the same underlying commitment. There are {num_link_pairs} synchronization links; each link forces two choices to take the same on/off status, ensuring that mirrored representations stay aligned.\n\nIn addition, there are {num_balance_groups} balance groups that enforce that two equally-sized pools of choices stay in equilibrium: within each group, the number of selected choices on the “positive side” must match the number selected on the “negative side”.\n\nThe plan must avoid incompatible combinations captured by {num_conflict_groups} conflict groups (at most one choice may be selected in each group). It must also satisfy minimum selection expectations across {num_coverage_groups} coverage groups (at least a required number of members must be selected).\n\nFurther, there are {num_cap_groups} cap rules that limit how many items may be selected within certain protected subsets.\n\nFinally, the instance contains {num_mix_dimensions} policy dimensions that limit how concentrated a certain attribute may be among selected choices, and a small set of additional linear rules that do not fit the higher-level families.\n\nThe goal is to select a consistent set of choices that respects all operational rules and yields the minimum total net cost.",
