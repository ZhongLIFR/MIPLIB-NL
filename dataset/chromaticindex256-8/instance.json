  "abstract_problem": "We are designing a next-generation optical interconnect architecture for a high-performance computing cluster consisting of {n} modular server racks. Each rack contains 12 Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), indexed globally based on their rack sequence. For the k-th rack (where k ranges from 1 to {n}), the QPUs are assigned IDs from 12(k-1) to 12k-1. For configuration purposes, within each rack, we refer to these as local node 0 through local node 11. The network topology is constructed using specific fiber optic channels. First, within every rack, a 'Control Plane Ring' is established by sequentially connecting local nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, closing the loop by connecting node 6 back to node 0 (forming a 7-node cycle). To manage thermal distribution, the QPUs in this ring are spaced 15 cm apart. Second, a 'Data Plane Ring' is formed within each rack to handle heavy distinct workloads; this connects local nodes 7, 9, 11, 8, and 10 in that specific sequence, with node 10 connecting back to node 7 to complete the loop (forming a 5-node cycle). The power consumption of nodes in the Data Plane is rated at 120W, whereas Control Plane nodes consume 85W. Third, 'Cross-Layer Bridges' are installed to link the two planes: in a standard configuration, connections are made between node 0 and 7, 2 and 8, 3 and 9, 5 and 10, and 6 and 11. However, due to a manufacturing defect in the first rack (Rack 1) specifically, the bridge between node 3 and node 9 is physically impossible and is omitted; to compensate, a bypass connection is welded between node 4 and node 9 in this first rack only. Finally, to integrate the cluster, an 'Inter-Rack Cascade' connects local node 4 of each rack to local node 1 of the immediately preceding rack (starting from Rack 2, connecting Rack k's node 4 to Rack k-1's node 1). The total fiber length for these inter-rack connections is optimized to minimize signal latency, which averages 0.5 microseconds per hop. At the completion of this assembly, with the specific exceptions of node 3 in the first rack and node 1 in the final rack, every QPU manages exactly 3 active fiber ports. We employ Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) where each fiber link must carry a specific light frequency (color). To prevent signal interference, any two fiber links sharing a common QPU must use different frequencies. What is the minimum number of distinct frequencies required to configure the entire network successfully?",
