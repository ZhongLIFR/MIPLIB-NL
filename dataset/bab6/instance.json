  "abstract_problem": "A transportation provider plans a set of profitable vehicle operations while simultaneously building a feasible crew plan that can cover those operations. Both the vehicle side and the crew side are represented as discrete time-space transitions: selecting a transition means committing to a specific movement or linkage in the plan.\n\nDuring the planning horizon, there are {num_start_slots} independent starting requirements. For each requirement, exactly one starting option must be chosen so that a corresponding operational stream can begin.\n\nThe plan must remain internally consistent across a time-space network with {num_flow_nodes} balance nodes. Selecting a transition contributes to the balance of its incident nodes, so that coherent streams can be formed rather than isolated fragments.\n\nOperational activity is paced across {num_windows} windows. In each window, the number of selected activity transitions must stay within a window-specific band, and it must also respect a hard upper limit. In addition, there are {num_mix_dimensions} policy dimensions that limit how concentrated certain attributes may be among the selected transitions.\n\nThe plan must satisfy minimum coverage expectations across {num_coverage_groups} groups and avoid incompatible combinations captured by {num_conflict_groups} incompatibility groups. Some choices are only meaningful when at least one supporting continuation is also chosen, and some families of choices are governed by an explicit gate that must be active before the family can contribute.\n\nFinally, there are {num_cap_groups} small cap rules that limit how many items may be selected within certain protected subsets.\n\nEach selectable choice has a net cost that can be positive (expense) or negative (profit credit). The goal is to select a consistent set of choices that respects all operational rules and yields the minimum total net cost.",
