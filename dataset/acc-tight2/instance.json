  "abstract_problem": "A media operator plans a tightly regulated schedule over {T} periods and {J} channels.\n\nIn each period, exactly one channel receives the headline placement, and each channel must receive the headline placement exactly {headline_quota_per_channel} times over the whole horizon.\n\nIn addition, each period must include exactly {support_quota_per_period} channels that act as \"support hosts\". For every (period, channel) pair, the operator must pick exactly one action: either the channel takes the headline, or it becomes a support host, or it sends a directed cross-channel promotion to exactly one other channel.\n\nWhich directed promotions are allowed is defined by the set of (sender_channel_id, target_channel_id) pairs listed in the promotion-requirement file. Any directed pair not listed there is not an allowed option.\n\nCross-channel promotions are tightly controlled: whenever a channel promotes into another channel in a period, the destination channel must be a support host in that same period, and each channel can receive at most one incoming promotion per period.\n\nOver the full horizon, each allowed directed pair must be used exactly the required number of times (in this instance it is exactly once for every pair of distinct channels, so each channel sends {K} promotions in total).\n\nTo keep the plan realistic and evenly paced, the schedule must satisfy strict cadence rules expressed as time-window bounds. These rules limit how concentrated or how sparse a channel's support hosting can be over time, limit how headline and hosting actions can cluster, and also limit how frequently a channel can spend periods sending promotions.\n\nThe objective is to avoid placing the headline on channel {penalized_channel} in period {penalized_period} unless it is unavoidable, while still meeting all operational rules.",
