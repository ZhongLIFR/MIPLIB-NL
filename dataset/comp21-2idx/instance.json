  "abstract_problem": "The University Resource Allocation Committee (URAC) is responsible for scheduling {C} courses into a weekly timetable. The academic week consists of {D} teaching days, with each day divided into {P} teaching periods, resulting in a total of {T} available time slots. Each course has a specific number of weekly meetings (lectures) that must be scheduled. To ensure pedagogical quality, each course should be spread across at least a minimum number of distinct days. If a course is scheduled on fewer days than its required minimum, a penalty with weight {w_days_below} is applied for each missing day.\n\nThere are {CP} identified conflict pairs between courses (e.g., due to overlapping student enrollment or shared instructors); such courses cannot be scheduled in the same time slot. Furthermore, courses may have specific blackout periods during which they cannot be taught. The campus classroom inventory consists of various rooms with different seating capacities. In any given time slot, at most {max_rooms_per_slot} simultaneous classes can be held, corresponding to the total number of available rooms. Time slots are labeled using the scheme 'D<day>P<period>' (e.g., 'D0P0' for the first period of the first day).\n\nClassroom capacity is managed through a series of seating thresholds. For each threshold, there is a limit on how many classes can simultaneously occupy rooms that meet or exceed that capacity. If a course meeting is scheduled but cannot be assigned a room that meets a specific threshold, it may still proceed in a smaller room, but it incurs a capacity shortfall penalty. The penalty weight for such a shortfall depends on both the course and the specific threshold (weights range from {penalty_min} to {penalty_max}). If a course-threshold combination is not explicitly assigned a weight in the data, the penalty is assumed to be zero. However, all meetings must still be accounted for within the overall room availability limits.\n\nCourses are also organized into {Q} curricula (study tracks). To maintain a coherent schedule for students, URAC penalizes 'isolated' course occurrences within a curriculum. An isolation penalty with weight {w_isolated} is incurred if a curriculum has a scheduled meeting in a period but no meetings in the immediately adjacent period(s) of the same day. Isolation is evaluated for every period of a day; boundary periods (the first and last periods of a day) consider only their single adjacent period. The objective is to find a feasible timetable that minimizes the total penalty from capacity shortfalls, insufficient day spreading, and curriculum isolation.",
