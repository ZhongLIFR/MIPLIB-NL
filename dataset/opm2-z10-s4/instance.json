  "abstract_problem": "The Omega-7 Quantum Simulation Grid is initializing a high-fidelity computation cycle involving {n} discrete computational shards. Each shard offers a specific Quantum Coherence Yield (QCY), a value derived from the stability of the qubit array, where positive values indicate data gain and negative values represent necessary error-correction overhead. The grid operates across {m} distinct system vectors, such as logic gate bandwidth, memory lattice tension, and qubit harmonics. To ensure system stability, every single system vector is governed by a unified strict saturation threshold of {resource_capacity} units. Furthermore, quantum entanglement dictates strict topology rules: there are {k} entanglement pairs established by the system architect. For any pair (Shard A, Shard B), the activation of Shard A physically necessitates the simultaneous activation of Shard B to prevent wave-function collapse. Additionally, shards are categorized by their index parity into 'Spin-Up' (even IDs) and 'Spin-Down' (odd IDs) clusters for post-processing visualization. The cooling infrastructure automatically dissipates heat generated by the selection, calculated as 0.04% of the total resource load. The primary objective is to determine the optimal configuration of active shards that maximizes the aggregate QCY while strictly adhering to vector saturation limits and entanglement topology requirements.",
