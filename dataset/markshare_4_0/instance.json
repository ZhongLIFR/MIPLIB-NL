  "abstract_problem": "A retail conglomerate is curating its product assortment strategy for the upcoming fiscal quarter across four distinct regional zones. The core objective is to assemble a portfolio of offerings that sufficiently penetrates each regional market, ensuring that the cumulative consumer interest generated by the selected items meets or exceeds specific regional thresholds. Rather than simply maximizing sales, the focus is on achieving a balanced market presence where every zone's engagement targets are satisfied through the strategic inclusion of products.\n\nEach potential product in the catalog has a unique profile of appeal that varies by region,some are universally popular, while others have niche strengths. The decision-making process is binary: a product is either stocked across the network or dropped entirely, meaning its contribution (or lack thereof) is felt simultaneously in all regions. However, the system allows for flexibility in how these targets are met; the goal is to minimize the deviation or 'slack' below the target levels, effectively penalizing any underperformance in market coverage. Operational success is defined by finding the precise combination of products that closes the gap between actual market engagement and the projected targets, ensuring no region is left underserved.",
