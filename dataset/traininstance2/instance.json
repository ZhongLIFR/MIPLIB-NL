  "abstract_problem": "A regional railway operator manages a single rail corridor with {num_stations} stations served by {num_trains} trains. The goal is to schedule the trains to minimize the weighted sum of arrival times at specific key stations, subject to strict deadlines and safety headway constraints. Each train has a specific weight reflecting its priority or passenger load. Certain trains must depart from or arrive at specific stations before a given deadline. Additionally, for safety reasons, a minimum headway of {headway_minutes} minutes must be maintained between any two consecutive trains at every station (both for arrival and departure).",
