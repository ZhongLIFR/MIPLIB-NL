  "abstract_problem": "A transportation provider plans a set of profitable vehicle operations while simultaneously building a feasible crew plan that can cover those operations. Both the vehicle side and the crew side are represented as discrete time-space transitions: selecting a transition means committing to a specific movement or linkage in the plan.\n\nDuring the planning horizon, there are {num_start_slots} independent starting requirements. For each requirement, exactly one starting option must be chosen so that a corresponding operational stream can begin.\n\nSome operational blocks are only meaningful if they are opened and properly “anchored” at both ends. The instance contains {num_packages} such blocks. When a block is opened, exactly two associated boundary choices must be selected, reflecting that the block must have a valid start and a valid end within the overall plan.\n\nOperational activity is also paced across {num_windows} windows. In each window, the number of selected vehicle-side transitions must remain within a window-specific band and must not exceed a hard limit. In addition, there are {num_mix_dimensions} policy dimensions that limit how concentrated certain vehicle-side attributes can be among the selected transitions.\n\nThe plan must also satisfy minimum coverage expectations across {num_coverage_groups} groups and avoid incompatible combinations captured by {num_conflict_groups} conflict groups. Finally, some choices only make sense when at least one supporting continuation is also chosen.\n\nEach selectable choice has a net cost that can be positive (expense) or negative (profit credit). The goal is to select a consistent set of choices that respects all operational rules and yields the minimum total net cost.",
