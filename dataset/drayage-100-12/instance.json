  "abstract_problem": "This instance describes dispatch planning for short-haul container moves around a terminal and its nearby transfer points. There are {N} transport orders and {M} available chassis. The planner must decide a one-to-one pairing so that every order is covered and every chassis is used exactly once. Pairing is allowed for any order-chassis combination; the data provide explicit cost entries for some pairings and all other pairings use an implicit baseline cost of {baseline_assignment_cost}. The plan also tracks {num_time_vars} event timestamps for key visits or handoffs. Operational policies are given as standardized rule records that link pairing choices to timing consistency requirements and to shared-facility limits aggregated over a single referenced order set (the set may cover only a subset of orders). In this instance, each order has a designated primary chassis option that shares the same identifier as the order, and timing-shift rules describe how the required time gap changes when switching from that primary option to an alternative. Each rule table uses a uniform comparison direction code, given by {pair_time_link_default_sense} for timing-shift rules and {chassis_time_default_sense} for group-aggregation rules. Timing-shift rules also rely on a shared large adjustment constant {pair_time_link_big_m}. All identifiers in the data files are zero-based. The goal is to find a feasible plan with minimum total cost.",
