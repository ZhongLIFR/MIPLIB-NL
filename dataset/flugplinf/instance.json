  "abstract_problem": "An airline currently has N1 pilots. It needs to fulfill the tasks over the next N2 months. Each regular pilot can complete N3 units of tasks during working hours, and the monthly salary for each pilot is N4. At the end of each month, a proportion of N5 of the pilots will leave the company.To ensure the long-term operation of the company, a certain number of student pilots are recruited each month. These student pilots will become regular pilots after one month of training. During the training month, each student pilot will add N6 units of tasks to the company. The monthly salary for each student pilot during the training period is N7. The number of student pilots recruited by the airline each month shall not exceed N8. In addition, the total number of pilots employed by the airline in any given month must be no more than N9 and no less than N10.The regular monthly task volume for the N2 months is provided in the task table (excluding the additional tasks generated by training student pilots). If the total tasks cannot be completed within working hours, regular pilots will be required to work overtime to finish the remaining tasks. The volume of tasks completed via overtime shall not exceed N11 times the number of regular pilots. For each unit of task completed through overtime work, an additional N12 units of salary shall be paid to the pilots.Is it possible to reasonably arrange the monthly recruitment of student pilots and overtime work such that the airline can complete all tasks over the N2 months with a total cost of less than N13? If possible, output the minimum cost required to complete the tasks; if not, output 'impossible'. The number of pilots must always be an integer.",
