  "abstract_problem": "We are designing a frequency allocation plan for a large-scale distributed radar array system named 'Argus-12'. The system consists of {n} independent radar array clusters. Each cluster contains 12 signal processing units (nodes), indexed locally from 0 to 11. To ensure data synchronization, specific physical fiber links are established within and between these clusters. Within every cluster, the units indexed 0 through 6 form a primary telemetry loop (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0), operating on high-bandwidth multi-mode fiber with a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. Simultaneously, units 7, 9, 11, 8, and 10 form a secondary backup loop in that specific sequence (7-9-11-8-10-7), utilizing single-mode fiber for long-distance stability. Internal synchronization bridges connect specific pairs of units within each cluster: unit 0 connects to 7, 2 to 8, 3 to 9, 5 to 10, and 6 to 11. These bridges consume 15W of power each. A structural variation exists in the first cluster (Cluster 1) due to power supply constraints: the bridge between unit 3 and unit 9 is omitted, and replaced by a bridge connecting unit 4 and unit 9. Inter-cluster communication is established by connecting unit 4 of the k-th cluster to unit 1 of the (k-1)-th cluster for all k from 2 to {n}, creating a cascading uplink chain. The signal propagation delay on these inter-cluster links is fixed at 12ms. Aside from the topological exceptions at unit 3 of the first cluster and unit 1 of the final cluster, the network topology ensures uniform connectivity degree. To prevent signal interference, any two fiber links sharing a common processing unit must operate on distinct frequency channels. We need to determine the minimum number of unique frequency channels required to activate the entire network simultaneously.",
