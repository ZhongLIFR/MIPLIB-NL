  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are the project manager of a large-scale construction project. The project is decomposed into N1 distinct sub-tasks (e.g., foundation, wiring, or plumbing for specific structures). You have N2 different subcontractors available to perform these tasks. Each subcontractor has a maximum global capacity for resources (e.g., total available equipment hours or workforce). Assigning a specific subcontractor to execute a specific task consumes a certain amount of this global resource.\n\nAdditionally, the construction site is spatially or temporally divided into M distinct zones (or phases). Each zone comprises a specific block of consecutive tasks. Within each zone, there is a strict limit on local resource usage (e.g., physical storage space or local power load). Assigning a subcontractor to perform a task within a specific zone consumes a specific amount of this local resource. Furthermore, assigning a specific task to a specific subcontractor yields a defined profit.\n\nThe total potential value of the project is fixed at {r0124_constant}. The objective variable represents the 'unrealized profit' (or opportunity cost), calculated as the total potential value minus the sum of profits from all assigned tasks. Therefore, minimizing this unrealized profit is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the total profit obtained from task assignments.\n\nYour goal is to assign each task to at most one subcontractor to maximize the total project profit (or minimize the unrealized profit), while ensuring that no subcontractor exceeds their global resource capacity and no zone exceeds its local resource limit. Output the value of the minimized unrealized profit.",
