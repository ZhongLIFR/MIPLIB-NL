  "abstract_problem": "We are engineering a high-dimensional linear discriminator for a precision oncology screening program involving {n_samples} clinical subjects. The dataset includes {n_features} gene expression markers per subject. The cohort is divided into {n_pos} confirmed pathology cases and {n_neg} control subjects. Due to potential thermal fluctuations during the PCR amplification cycles, particularly in batches processed during peak hours, the modeling framework must incorporate a noise-rejection mechanism. This mechanism allows the solver to categorize specific subjects as 'conforming' or 'deviant' via a binary decision variable. The optimization goal is to minimize a composite cost function consisting of three components. First, to enforce model sparsity and identify biomarker signatures, the L1 norm of the feature weight vector u is minimized. Second, for subjects categorized as 'conforming', the model incurs a weighted Hinge Loss relative to a standard classification margin of 1. Third, subjects flagged as 'deviant' bypass the standard margin requirement but incur a fixed 'manual review' penalty cost. This fixed penalty is calculated as {cost_ratio_outlier} times the class-specific importance weight of the subject. The importance weights are derived by distributing a global regularization intensity {C_global} inversely proportional to the number of samples in each class to ensure actuarial fairness. A saturation parameter {M} is introduced to mathematically relax the constraints for deviant samples. It is important to note that due to the finite nature of this saturation limit, any margin violation that geographically exceeds {M} will still contribute residual penalties to the objective function, even if the sample is flagged as deviant. The top 5% of samples with the highest decision values will be prioritized for longitudinal follow-up studies next year. The solver must determine the optimal weights u and bias b.",
