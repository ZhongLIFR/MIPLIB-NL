  "abstract_problem": "The Global Network Infrastructure Initiative is upgrading its telecommunications grid across {n} regional sectors. To comply with the hardware allocation budget set for the upcoming fiscal decade, the engineering board has authorized the activation of exactly {p} sectors to serve as Primary Uplink Nodes. Each sector functions under a specific routing protocol defined in the `chains` registry. This registry dictates a rigid priority sequence of potential Uplink Nodes for every sector acting as a data origin. When a sector initiates a data transmission, the network protocol scans its assigned priority sequence in ascending order and connects to the first sector that has been activated as a Primary Uplink Node. The system efficiency metric, known as the Transmission Lag Index, is calculated for each sector as the zero-based ordinal position of the connected Uplink Node within that sector's specific priority chain. Additionally, sectors with identification numbers divisible by 4 contain legacy copper infrastructure requiring distinct maintenance schedules compared to the fiber-optic cables in odd-numbered sectors, which have a signal attenuation rate of 0.05dB per kilometer. Any sector not chosen as a Primary Uplink Node will revert to a passive relay state, consuming 15% of the standard energy output to maintain heartbeat signals. The objective is to identify the optimal set of Uplink Nodes to minimize the total Transmission Lag Index across all sectors.",
