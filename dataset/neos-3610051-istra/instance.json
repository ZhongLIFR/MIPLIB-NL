  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are a safety engineer at a chemical plant monitoring the pressure levels of a multi-stage reaction process. The process consists of a long sequence of time steps (Total Steps: N1). Under normal physical conditions, the pressure change between two consecutive time steps must fall within a specific natural drift range. However, external interventions allow the pressure to jump beyond these limits. Crucially, the system state at each step is also constrained by time-varying safety bounds (Table D5). You need to determine the sequence of pressure states that satisfies all drift, connectivity, and safety bound constraints while minimizing the total number of interventions.",
