  "abstract_problem": "A domestic service company needs to process N1 tasks, with each task yielding a revenue of R. To achieve this, the company needs to hire a certain number of employees from a pool of N2 candidates. The salary for each employee is provided in Table C1; some of these employees are interns willing to pay for the internship, resulting in negative salaries. The contribution of each employee to each task is provided in Table C2; some employees may have a negative impact on certain tasks, resulting in negative contribution values. Within the workforce, the maximum age is Y1 and the minimum age is Y2. The completion threshold required for each task is provided in Table C3. We need to help the company determine an employee selection scheme that minimizes costs while ensuring all tasks are completed. Output the minimum cost value.",
