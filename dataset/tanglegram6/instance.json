  "abstract_problem": "A systems biology team is consolidating a gene regulatory knowledge base built from multiple experiments and curation pipelines. Each pipeline may use a different sign convention for what it considers an \"increase\" versus a \"decrease\" in activity, so the same biological relationship can appear inconsistent across sources.\n\nTo harmonize the knowledge base, the team chooses a binary reference orientation for each of the {num_entities} entities (think of it as deciding whether to keep or flip that entity's sign convention relative to a shared reference). The dataset contains {num_evidence} pairwise evidence records linking two entities at a time. Each record is described using business-facing categorical fields (such as an effect type and a comparison domain) and a weight. A separate semantics table defines how each category combination should be interpreted as an expectation about whether the two entities should end up aligned or opposed after harmonization.\n\nAfter selecting reference orientations, some evidence records will become incompatible with the chosen orientations. Every incompatible record contributes a penalty proportional to its weight (with unit scale {violation_unit_cost}). The goal is to choose orientations that minimize the total incompatibility penalty across all evidence.",
