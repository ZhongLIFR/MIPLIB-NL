  "abstract_problem": "We are playing a script-based murder mystery game where I play the owner of a freight company with a total market value of W billion. I have been assigned a task: transport goods from N1 factories to N2 customers. We must select specific routes to open from N1*N2 possible options and determine the quantity of goods transported on each route (which does not have to be an integer). When selecting routes, I must communicate with at least N game DMs. Opening each route requires paying a fixed cost, as shown in Table C1. Additionally, transporting one unit of cargo on each route incurs a shipping fee, as shown in Table C2. The quantity of goods produced by each factory is fixed, as shown in Table C3; the quantity transported out of a factory must equal its production volume. The quantity of goods required by each customer is also fixed, as shown in Table C4; the quantity received by each customer must equal their demand. Our objective is to determine the minimum cost to be paid while satisfying all conditions.",
