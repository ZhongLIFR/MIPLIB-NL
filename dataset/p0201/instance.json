  "abstract_problem": "A high-frequency trading data center manages two segregated server clusters, designated Cluster Odd and Cluster Even, to handle workload across {n} specific trading intervals. Cluster Odd is active strictly during intervals 1, 3, 5, etc., while Cluster Even assumes control during intervals 2, 4, 6, etc. Within each active interval, the operative cluster performs a reconfiguration maneuver, shifting from a specific 'entry mode' to an 'exit mode' selected from {num_states} distinct architectural configurations (Mode 0, 1, 2). Due to hardware state caching protocols, the exit mode established at the conclusion of interval {t} dictates the mandatory entry mode for the subsequent activation of that same cluster at interval {t}+2. The system generates three classes of digital assets (Asset A, Asset B, Asset C). Mode 0 generates {prod_rate_1} units of Asset A, Mode 1 generates {prod_rate_2} units of Asset B, and Mode 2 generates {prod_rate_3} units of Asset C per interval. Regulatory compliance requires that total accumulated assets satisfy a strictly increasing liquidity schedule. Specifically, at the checkpoints occurring at the end of intervals 2, 4, ..., {n}, the sum of cumulative production starting from interval 1 plus any pre-allocated reserve buffers must satisfy a threshold. This threshold for every asset class increases by {demand_amount} units after every {demand_interval} intervals. To mitigate shortfalls, the firm may procure 'reserve buffer units' before operations commence, capped at {max_inventory} integers per asset type, with pricing detailed in the `initial_inventory_costs` file. Unused reserves at the end of the horizon are donated to charity. Furthermore, changing modes incurs computational overhead costs listed in `transition_costs`. The system also logs a heat signature for every transition, which helps in long-term hardware lifespan analysis, and the transitions with the highest heat signatures are flagged for quarterly review. The objective is to determine the optimal strategy that minimizes the aggregate financial expenditure, defined strictly as the sum of reserve buffer acquisition costs and the cumulative interval reconfiguration costs.",
