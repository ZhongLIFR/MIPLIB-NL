  "abstract_problem": "There are I shipments and N transport trucks. We must assign a specific vehicle to each shipment. Among these N trucks, the proportion of heavy-duty trucks is P. Each shipment has a specific weight, and the weight data for each shipment is stored in the table weight.csv. The assignment is restricted by vehicle types (such as cold-chain trucks vs. ordinary trucks), and these restriction requirements are stored in table B1. More critically, the urban road network contains complex traffic bottlenecks: specific \"shipment-vehicle\" assignments determine the routes vehicles must take, which in turn leads to traffic flowing through specific road segments. In table B2, each row represents a specific road segment (or bridge), with a total of M segments. Following each segment is a list of \"shipment-vehicle\" assignments that pass through it, denoted as (i, j) where i represents the shipment and j represents the truck. If a \"shipment-vehicle\" assignment is fulfilled, it adds the transport load pressure of the corresponding shipment to that road segment. Different bridges and paths have different load capacities; in the city where we operate, the path with the highest load capacity is L times stronger than the one with the lowest. Our optimization goal is to find a loading scheme that, while satisfying vehicle type matching, minimizes the load on the most heavily pressured road segment in the entire urban network to prevent traffic paralysis or road damage.",
