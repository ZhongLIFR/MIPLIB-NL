  "abstract_problem": "A service organization is planning staffing for a single day that is divided into {N_time_slots} equal time slots (each slot is {time_granularity_minutes} minutes). There are {N_employees} employees available, identified as employee_id = 0..{N_employees_minus_1}.\n\nThe operation is open only during a service window of time slots (from time_id {work_window_start_time_id} to {work_window_end_time_id}, inclusive). For each time slot in this window, the business sets a target staffing level: how many employees should be actively working in that slot.\n\nIf the schedule assigns fewer working employees than the target in a given time slot, the shortfall is called understaffing. If the schedule assigns more working employees than the target, the surplus is called overstaffing. Both are allowed but create a cost. The costs are time-dependent: each time slot has its own understaffing and overstaffing penalty rates. A penalty rate is charged per person-slot of deviation (one person-slot means one missing or extra employee in one time slot).\n\n**Crucially, the organization does not need to utilize all available employees.** Each employee can either be assigned a shift or remain completely unassigned for the day. If an employee is unassigned, they do not work in any time slot, do not follow the rulebook described below, and incur zero labor cost. If an employee is assigned a shift, their day is described as a sequence of statuses over time defined by a compact rulebook, and due to the minimum work requirement ({min_work_slots} slots), assigned employees will necessarily work at least that amount.\n\nThe allowed sequences for assigned employees are defined by a compact rulebook (a small graph of states and labeled transitions). The business meaning is that the rulebook encodes what can happen next in an employee's day: remaining off duty, starting to work, continuing to work, taking a short break, taking a longer meal break, and ending the shift and staying off duty afterwards.\n\nThe rulebook is combined with shift policy rules for assigned employees:\n- If an employee works at all, their total number of working time slots must be between {min_work_slots} and {max_work_slots}.\n- Based on total working time, the employee is treated as either a short shift (at most {short_shift_max_work_slots} working slots) or a long shift (at least {long_shift_min_work_slots} working slots).\n- A short shift must include exactly {short_break_slots_short_shift} time slot of short break, while a long shift must include exactly {short_break_slots_long_shift} time slots of short break.\n- A long shift must additionally include a meal break that lasts exactly {meal_break_slots_long_shift} consecutive time slots. (A short shift has no meal break.)\n\nThe goal is to choose which employees to assign and their daily status sequences to minimize the total daily operating cost, which includes labor cost for working time and the time-slot-specific penalties for understaffing and overstaffing.",
