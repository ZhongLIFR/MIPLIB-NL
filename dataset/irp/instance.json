  "abstract_problem": "You are a logistics scheduler faced with a massive selection problem. Instead of planning routes from scratch, you have a pool of N pre-generated 'Candidate Delivery Schedules' (Variables). Each schedule is a complete plan for a vehicle, with a calculated operational cost. On the other hand, you have M specific 'Service Requirements' (Constraints), such as 'Customer X must be visited' or 'Vehicle Y can only be used once'. Your task is to select a subset of these candidate schedules to ensure that every Service Requirement is met exactly once (sum of selected schedules = 1), while minimizing the total cost of the selected schedules.",
