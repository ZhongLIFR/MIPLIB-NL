  "abstract_problem": "We are tasked with optimizing a linear compliance scoring system for {n_samples} financial entities, each characterized by {n_features} quantitative risk indicators. The goal is to determine the optimal weight vector u and intercept b to minimize a tripartite operational cost function. The first component is a sparsity penalty defined by the L1 norm of u, ensuring the model relies on a minimal set of indicators. The second and third components define the classification loss: the system dynamically assigns each entity to either a 'Standard Protocol' or an 'Exception Protocol'. Entities under the Standard Protocol enforce a strict margin constraint; any violation of this margin results in a variable penalty proportional to the violation magnitude (Weighted Hinge Loss). Entities assigned to the Exception Protocol are granted a relaxation buffer of size {M}, effectively ignoring margin violations up to this limit. However, activating the Exception Protocol incurs a fixed 'Administrative Fee' for that entity, calculated as {cost_ratio_outlier} times the entity's specific importance weight. It is crucial to note that the relaxation buffer is finite; if an Exception entity's violation exceeds {M}, the residual violation beyond {M} is still charged as a variable penalty. The importance weights are stratified by class to ensure fairness: {C_global}/{n_pos} for positive class entities and {C_global}/{n_neg} for negative class entities. Regarding the input data structure, features indexed 1 through 10 are derived from high-frequency trading logs, while the remaining features come from quarterly balance sheets. The high-frequency logs are subject to a 5ms latency during real-time inference, whereas balance sheet data is static. Additionally, the IT department charges a maintenance fee of 0.01 per non-zero weight per year after deployment. The optimization problem solely concerns the minimization of the training objective function (Sparsity + Variable Penalties + Administrative Fees).",
