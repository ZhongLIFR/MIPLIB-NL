  "abstract_problem": "A petrochemical engineering firm manages a refining grid with {n} reactor nodes. The network relies on mass balance where specific nodes act as solvent sources (negative load) and others as sinks (positive load), ensuring total system equilibrium. There are {m} provisioned pipeline interconnects. Fluid transfer is permissible in both directions along these lines. Activating a flow vector requires installing a unidirectional check-valve system and conducting a static pressure test, representing a fixed initialization expenditure. Operational transfer incurs a variable energy cost per volumetric unit due to pump friction. To ensure safety compliance, odd-numbered reactors are designated as Primary Safety Zones, while even-numbered reactors are Secondary Safety Zones, a classification used for regulatory reporting during the annual audit. Each pipeline is restricted by a physical flow limit of {capacity} units to prevent cavitation. Upon completion of the setup, the facility management allocates an annual maintenance budget equal to 7.5 percent of the total fixed initialization expenditure for long-term upkeep. The optimization target is to fulfill all solvent transfer requirements at the minimum combined cost of valve initialization and active pumping energy.",
