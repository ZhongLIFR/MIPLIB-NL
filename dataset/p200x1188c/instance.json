  "abstract_problem": "The Zenith Conglomerate is initiating the layout design for a high-throughput fluid distribution matrix, termed Project Alpha. The geospatial topology comprises {n} designated control points. Within this set, {num_sources} nodes act as Primary Injection Sites (positive net inventory), while exactly 1 node serves as the Terminal Aggregation Hub (negative net inventory, representing total system demand). The remaining {num_trans} nodes are designated as Transit Manifolds, maintaining a strict net-zero accumulation state. Detailed inventory metrics for each location are provided in the `nodes` dataset. The infrastructure planning division has identified {m} potential unidirectional linkage vectors (pipelines) connecting these points. The capital expenditure (CAPEX) required to commission each specific link is tabulated in the `edges` file. Under the Fiscal Policy 2025 guidelines, the operational expenditure (OPEX) for the network is projected at 6.5% of the total CAPEX annually. Furthermore, nodes are administratively categorized: those with even identification numbers fall under Zone A (requiring quarterly compliance audits), while odd-numbered nodes belong to Zone B. The selected conduit material supports a flow regime equivalent to infinite capacity, negating the need for Darcy-Weisbach friction loss calculations. The primary objective is to select a subset of these directed vectors to establish a fully connected flow from all Injection Sites to the Aggregation Hub. Determine the minimum total CAPEX required for the initial construction of this network.",
