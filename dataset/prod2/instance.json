  "abstract_problem": "An asset management firm is constructing a robust investment portfolio. The portfolio is composed of M distinct investment sectors (e.g., Technology, Healthcare, Energy, Real Estate, Consumer Goods, Emerging Markets, Bonds). For each sector, the analysis team has identified several candidate assets (specific stocks or funds), and exactly one asset must be selected from the available options for each sector to ensure diversification (mutual exclusion constraint). Portfolio managers must choose precisely one asset from each sector to form the final portfolio. Meanwhile, the risk management department has simulated N potential future economic scenarios (market conditions). These N constraints represent the performance models for N different market environments. The return of the portfolio in each scenario depends on the linear combination of the predicted returns of the selected assets. If the combined portfolio return in a specific scenario exceeds a required benchmark return, the portfolio is deemed 'resilient' in that scenario; otherwise, it is deemed 'underperforming'. The goal is to maximize the number of resilient scenarios.",
