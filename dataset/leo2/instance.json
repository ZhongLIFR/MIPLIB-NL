  "abstract_problem": "An organization is selecting a bundle from {num_options} candidate actions. Each action is either adopted or not adopted (partial adoption is not allowed). Actions are pre-arranged into {num_groups} menus, where each action belongs to exactly one menu and the organization can choose at most {max_choices_per_group} actions from each menu. If an action is adopted, it incurs a cost given per action. At the same time, the organization must hit {num_targets} organization-wide performance targets (for example, service outcomes, capability milestones, coverage levels, or compliance requirements). Each adopted action contributes some amount toward these targets, and contributions add up across adopted actions. For every target, the total contribution from the chosen actions must meet or exceed the required level given in the data. The goal is to satisfy all targets while keeping total cost as low as possible.",
