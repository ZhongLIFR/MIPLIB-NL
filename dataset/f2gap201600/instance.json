  "abstract_problem": "A fund company had an annual income of R last year. The current task is to cover N1 risk exposures (each has been confirmed N times). To achieve this, the company needs to select and hold a certain number of financial products from N2 available options. The holding cost for each product is provided in Table C1; some products are arbitrage tools that generate fixed interest income (exceeding management fees), resulting in negative costs. The coverage capability of each product for each risk exposure is provided in Table C2; some products are inversely linked to certain exposures (increasing risk exposure), resulting in negative coverage capabilities. The coverage threshold required for each risk exposure is provided in Table C3. The company requires our assistance in selecting products and achieving the strategic goal of a T percentage point increase in yield by the next milestone. We need to help the company determine a product selection scheme that minimizes costs while ensuring all risk exposures are covered. Output the minimum cost value.",
