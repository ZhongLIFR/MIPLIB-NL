  "abstract_problem": "This is a multi-period production planning problem with T periods and N decision variables. The system is modeled using four sets of periodic constraints and one set of structural logic constraints.\n\n1. **Resource Capacity Constraints**: In each period t, the weighted sum of variable activities (using irregular positive/negative coefficients defined in Table C3) must not exceed a resource upper bound L_t (Table C1).\n2. **Demand Satisfaction Constraints**: The total production output (using capacity rates defined in Table C3) must meet the cumulative demand D_t (Table C1).\n3. **Minimum Production Constraints**: The system must maintain a minimum activity level P_min_t (Table C1), calculated using specific coefficients in Table C3.\n4. **Inventory Capacity Constraints**: The inventory usage (using coefficients defined in Table C3) must not exceed the storage limit I_max_t (Table C1).\n5. **Structural & Logic Constraints**: A complex set of non-periodic constraints enforcing flow balance, mutual exclusivity, and setup logic (Big-M constraints) defined explicitly in Table C4.\n\nThe objective is to minimize total operational costs based on coefficients in Table C2.If there are no feasible decisions that satisfy the conditions, output \"infeasible\"; if a feasible solution exists, output the minimized cost.",
