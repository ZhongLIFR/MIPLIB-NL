  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are the crew scheduling manager for a major airline. You have a schedule of N1 flight legs that must be operated in a specific period. Based on regulations and logistics, your team has generated N2 possible crew pairings (a pairing is a sequence of flights a single crew can legally fly). The operational cost for each pairing is listed in Table C1. The specific flight legs included in each pairing are detailed in Table C2. Your goal is to select a subset of these pairings such that every single flight leg is covered exactly once, minimizing the total operational cost.",
