  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are the Operations Director of a chemical processing company. You manage a network that sources raw materials from N1 supply regions. Each region supplies N_Items distinct types of raw materials . You process them through specific production lines and fulfill contracts for N3 potential strategic partners.\n\nYour goal is to maximize total net profit (which is equivalent to minimizing the negative of profit).\n\nKey operations involve:\n1. **Sourcing:** Obtaining N_Items types of raw materials from N1 different supply groups. Each group has a total capacity limit for the sum of all its items.\n2. **Processing & Splitting:** Raw materials are processed. The logic corresponds to the N_Items types: some transfer 100% of the volume, while others chemically separate the input into 80% Main Product and 20% By-Product.\n3. **Production Line Decisions:** You have N2 binary production decisions (including lines and special batches). Activating a decision incurs a fixed setup cost/benefit. Most decisions are tied to the capacity of processing a specific Item Type (Big-M constraint).\n4. **Strategic Contracts:** There are major strategic contracts available. Accepting a contract brings a large fixed bonus but requires allocating significant production capacity. You are limited to selecting at most 4 out of these strategic contracts.\n5. **Distribution:** Processed goods are sent to distribution zones, which also have capacity limits.",
