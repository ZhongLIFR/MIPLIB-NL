  "abstract_problem": "In a high-security virology research facility, scientists are establishing a reference library for viral strains. Each strain is characterized by a genetic signature consisting of a binary sequence of length {n_bits}. In this sequence, a '1' represents the presence of a specific active protein marker, while a '0' indicates its absence. The storage facility operates under strict budget constraints: strains with more than 6 active markers require liquid nitrogen storage costing $15 per day, whereas others are stored in standard freezers at $4 per day. Additionally, the gene markers are categorized into two functional groups based on whether their position index is odd or even, which will be used for a separate statistical correlation study after the selection process. To ensure the integrity of the reference library during a 5-year longitudinal study, the selected set of strains must be distinct enough to prevent misidentification caused by common mutation patterns. There are two specific types of mutations to consider: 1. Spontaneous Toggle: A single marker flips its state (0 becomes 1, or 1 becomes 0). 2. Translocation: The states of markers at any two arbitrary distinct positions are swapped (e.g., a 1 at position i and a 0 at position j exchange places). The research protocol requires identifying a valid subset of binary sequences to form the library. The defining condition is that no two strains in the selected subset can be transformed into each other by exactly one Spontaneous Toggle or exactly one Translocation event. Furthermore, the first 5 strains identified by the algorithm will be subject to an additional manual verification process. Calculate the maximum number of distinct viral strain sequences that can be selected to compose such a valid reference library.",
