  "abstract_problem": "I am a mathematician with N sets selected from M mathematical textbooks. The optimization objective is to select the minimum number of sets such that each integer from 1 to I is covered exactly once. Additionally, the sets provided are not entirely selected from textbooks; half of them are randomly generated by a large language model. The integers contained in each set are listed in Table S1, and each set in S1 can be selected either 0 or 1 time (i.e., it is either not selected at all or selected exactly once).",
