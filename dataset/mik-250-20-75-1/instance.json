  "abstract_problem": "This is a large-scale computational resource orchestration scenario involving {n} edge computing nodes. The nodes are geographically classified into East and West zones based on their IDs; odd-numbered nodes belong to the East zone, while even-numbered nodes are in the West zone, where the East zone nodes are known to have cooling efficiencies that fluctuate with seasonal monsoons. To maximize the net operational yield for the quarterly financial report, you must strategize the allocation of computational power. First, for each individual node, management must decide whether to deploy a premium algorithm module code-named 'Titan.' While this module generates significant revenue, it consumes a fixed amount of the node's computational headroom, and any node running Titan will be flagged as a priority target during the annual maintenance audit. Second, the marketing department has released requirements for {m} types of data stream processing services, and you need to determine the specific number of batches to accept for each service. This is a network-wide decision, meaning that authorizing one standard batch of a specific service induces a synchronized computational load across all nodes in the network to simulate redundancy in a distributed architecture. Note that the total accepted batches for each service cannot exceed its global market saturation limit. Although these two types of decisions originate from different departments, they physically compete for the same real-time computational capacity quota on each node. If a node's load exceeds its capacity, system failure ensues. To mitigate potential bottlenecks, the IT department offers {k} types of global architecture optimization schemes. You can invest any non-negative amount of funds into these schemes; for every standard unit of investment, the capacity quota of all nodes in the network increases by 1 unit simultaneously. Additionally, for specific nodes facing extreme pressure, it is permissible to lease temporary physical compute expansion packs. Each pack provides {generator_capacity} units of extra capacity at a leasing cost of {generator_cost}. Due to hardware interface limitations, each node can mount a maximum of {max_generators} such packs. Leased packs require asset inventory checks at the end of the month, but this does not alter their immediate usage cost. The ultimate goal is to find an optimal plan such that the sum of revenue from 'Titan' modules and data stream services, minus the costs of global architecture upgrades and temporary expansion pack leases, is maximized.",
