  "abstract_problem": "A media operator plans a tightly regulated schedule over {T} periods and {J} channels.\n\nIn each period, exactly one channel receives the headline placement, and each channel must receive the headline placement exactly {headline_quota_per_channel} times over the whole horizon.\n\nIn addition, each period must include exactly {support_quota_per_period} channels that act as \"support hosts\". For every (period, channel) pair, the operator must pick exactly one action: either the channel takes the headline, or it becomes a support host, or it sends a directed cross-channel promotion to exactly one other channel.\n\nWhich directed promotions are allowed is defined by the set of (sender_channel_id, target_channel_id) pairs listed in the promotion-requirement file. Any directed pair not listed there is not an allowed option.\n\nCross-channel promotions are tightly controlled: whenever a channel promotes into another channel in a period, the destination channel must be a support host in that same period, and each channel can receive at most one incoming promotion per period.\n\nOver the full horizon, each allowed directed pair must be used exactly the required number of times.\n\nAdditional policy constraints apply: some requirements are evaluated only on even-numbered periods, and a list of paired periods enforces cross-period coordination for both headlines and directed promotions.\n\nThe objective is to avoid placing the headline on channel {penalized_channel} in period {penalized_period} unless it is unavoidable, while still meeting all operational rules.",
