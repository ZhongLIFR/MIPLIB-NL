  "abstract_problem": "Assume you are a hydraulic engineer designing a pressure control plan for a large-scale chemical liquid transport network. The network consists of $N_1$ pressure nodes connected by $N_3$ pipe segments. Fluid flows from upstream to downstream, incurring specific pressure losses due to friction. To ensure flow stability, the pressure difference (Downstream - Upstream) across any segment must not exceed a specific natural limit defined by the pipe's physical properties. However, you have the option to utilize $N_2$ types of booster pump resources. Activating a specific pump resource incurs a fixed installation cost, but it provides a fixed pressure boost of $P_{boost}$ to all pipe segments associated with that resource, effectively relaxing the pressure drop constraint. Additionally, each node has a specific maximum allowable pressure limit. The project also incurs a fixed base construction cost of $C_{base}$. Your goal is to select which pump resources to activate to minimize the total cost (Base Cost + Installation Costs) while satisfying all pressure limits.",
