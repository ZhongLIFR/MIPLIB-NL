  "abstract_problem": "Consider a large-scale quantum processor array consisting of {n} distinct modular units, indexed sequentially from 1 to {n}. Each unit contains exactly 12 quantum bits (qubits), designated internally with local indices 0 through 11. To ensure thermodynamic stability during operation, the system requires a specific topological connectivity pattern for quantum entanglement. Within every module k, the primary stabilization ring connects qubits 0 through 6 in strictly ascending order (0-1, 1-2, ..., 5-6), closing the loop by linking qubit 6 back to qubit 0. The secondary coherence ring connects the remaining qubits in a specific non-sequential index order: 7 to 9, 9 to 11, 11 to 8, 8 to 10, and finally 10 back to 7. Maintenance protocols dictate that qubits with even indices in the secondary ring consume 15% more power during state transitions due to required error correction overhead.\n\nInternal synchronization bridges are established to link the two rings within each module. For a standard module configuration, bidirectional optical links are installed between the following qubit pairs: (0, 7), (2, 8), (3, 9), (5, 10), and (6, 11). Due to a lithography artifact in the initial production run, the first module (Module 1) possesses a unique hardware deviation where the standard connection between qubit 3 and 9 is physically impossible; this is substituted by a connection between qubit 4 and qubit 9. All other connections in Module 1 remain standard.\n\nTo form the global daisy-chain architecture, an inter-module bus connects qubit 4 of every module k (for k > 1) to qubit 1 of the preceding module k-1. The transmission latency on these bus lines is negligible compared to the internal bridges, and the total system power budget is capped at 1200kW per cluster. The engineering team must assign distinct frequency channels (colors) to every connection link to prevent signal crosstalk. The fundamental constraint is that any two links sharing a common qubit endpoint cannot operate on the same frequency channel. Given that the bandwidth licensing costs grow exponentially with the number of allocated channels, determine the minimum number of distinct frequency channels required to activate the entire network structure while satisfying the crosstalk constraints.",
