  "abstract_problem": "The Financial Technology Infrastructure Division manages a low-latency trading grid comprising {n} distributed processing nodes, each constrained by a baseline throughput capacity. The objective is to configure the system for the upcoming fiscal quarter to maximize the Net Operational Margin. Configuration involves several layers of decision-making. Firstly, a localized decision must be made for each node regarding the deployment of a proprietary Market Maker Bot. Deploying a bot yields a specific projected revenue stream but permanently occupies a fixed portion of that node's throughput for local computation. Secondly, the team must determine the execution volume for {m} distinct High-Frequency Arbitrage Strategies. Unlike the localized bots, these strategies are decentralized; executing one integer unit of a strategy imposes a synchronous ledger verification load across every single node in the grid simultaneously. Each strategy is subject to a strict global volume cap due to market liquidity constraints. To alleviate throughput bottlenecks, the department can authorize {k} types of Network Firmware Overhauls. These allow for arbitrary non-negative investment amounts, where every unit of investment universally expands the throughput capacity of all nodes in the grid by exactly 1 unit. Additionally, to handle peak loads, individual nodes can be augmented by leasing external FPGA Accelerator Cards. Each card provides a capacity boost of {generator_capacity} units at a leasing cost of {generator_cost}, with a physical limit of {max_generators} cards per node. It is noted that nodes with odd-numbered IDs utilize liquid cooling systems while even-numbered nodes use air cooling, requiring different maintenance schedules, and the top 5 most utilized nodes will be flagged for a post-quarter thermal audit. The Net Operational Margin is calculated as the total revenue from deployed Market Maker Bots and executed Arbitrage Strategies, minus the total capital expenditure on Network Firmware Overhauls and FPGA Accelerator leases.",
