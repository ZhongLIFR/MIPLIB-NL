  "abstract_problem": "We are designing the frequency allocation plan for a next-generation orbital communication array consisting of {n} distinct satellite clusters. Each cluster contains exactly 12 transceiver units. For a cluster k (ranging from 1 to {n}), the units are indexed sequentially based on their manufacturing batch, corresponding to relative IDs 0 through 11. To optimize thermal dissipation, units with even relative IDs utilize Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) amplifiers, while units with odd relative IDs employ Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology, requiring distinct power rail management. The internal network topology for every cluster is standardized as follows to ensure redundancy: a primary telemetry loop is formed by connecting units 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0 in a closed cycle; a secondary encrypted data loop connects units 7-9-11-8-10-7. To facilitate cross-layer data injection, hardwired internal bridges are established between the following pairs in each cluster: unit 0 with 7, 2 with 8, 3 with 9, 5 with 10, and 6 with 11. Due to the physical mounting of the main distinct antenna on the first cluster (Cluster 1), the standard bridge between unit 3 and unit 9 is physically obstructed and replaced by a bridge connecting unit 4 and unit 9; all other clusters follow the standard configuration. Inter-cluster communication is maintained by a series of long-range laser links, where unit 4 of each cluster connects to unit 1 of the immediately preceding cluster (applicable for clusters 2 through {n}). The spectrum regulatory body charges a licensing fee of $1.5 million USD per distinct frequency band utilized. The system requires a Conflict-Free Frequency Assignment (CFFA), meaning any two links sharing a common transceiver node must operate on different frequency bands to prevent signal interference. Determine the minimum number of distinct frequency bands that must be procured to fully operationalize the network.",
