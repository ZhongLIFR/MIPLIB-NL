  "abstract_problem": "A media operator is planning a campaign window involving {G} clients. Each client proposes a shortlist of commercial packages; across all clients there are {P} candidate packages in total. For any given client, at most one package can be signed. A signed package serves as a \"key\" that enables a catalog of executable opportunities associated with that package.\n\nAcross the window there are {O} opportunities. When an opportunity is activated, it delivers a known profit of {profit}. However, each opportunity also requires a specific combination of scarce inventory units (for example, particular time slots, placements, or audience-quota units). There are {R} inventory units in total, and each unit can be allocated to at most one activated opportunity during the window.\n\nThe operator must choose which packages to sign (possibly none for some clients) and which opportunities to activate, so that inventory is never double-booked and the campaign profit is as large as possible.",
